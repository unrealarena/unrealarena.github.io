<p>Unreal Arena is a fast-paced first-person shooter that aims to merge the universes of Unreal Tournament<sup><a href="/disclaimer">**</a></sup> and Quake III Arena<sup><a href="/disclaimer">**</a></sup>. The idea behind it is very simple: the player can choose from either side, determining in this way which weapons/items/movements are available, and fight against other players of the opposite faction with their own traits.</p>
