    The first snapshot of 2016 adds the long-awaited support for OS X!
  </p>
  <p>
    Now you can run Unreal Arena on any Mac that has OS X Mavericks or newer.
    The build infrastructure has been updated to take account of this and
    it is hosted by Travis CI as it is for Linux.
  </p>
  <p>
    The snapshot includes also some bug fixes along with the classic engine
    update (v0.43.1).
