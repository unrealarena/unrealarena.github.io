After some months of hard work we have managed to add our teams, Q and U, to
Unreal Arena. Players of the former will act as they would in Quake III Arena,
with its typical physics, weapons and items. Players of the latter will feel
instead the gameplay of Unreal Tournament.

Moreover, with this snapshot we have gone a step further and we have actually
made possible to play the game. Now you can spawn into our demo map,
Campgrounds, and move around it. We have already ported the original Quake III
Arena spawn logic while the other one is coming soon.

Other minor enhancements are the removal of the *suicide timer*, that had been
preventing the `/kill` command to run instantly, and the addition of the
`/suicide` alias which is better known to Unreal Tournament players.

Finally, this snapshot includes the usual engine update (v0.41.0).

[NOTE: since there are no menus you should take a look at the instructions on
the official [wiki](https://github.com/unrealarena/unrealarena/wiki) in order to
know how to properly run the game.]
