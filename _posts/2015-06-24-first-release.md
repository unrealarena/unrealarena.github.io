During last months we have worked hard first to set up what is needed for the
project development and then to effectively start working on it.

We have created other two repositories that are going to serve us along with the
main one: [unrealarena-data](https://github.com/unrealarena/unrealarena-data)
for the game assets and
[unrealarena-maps](https://github.com/unrealarena/unrealarena-maps) for the
official maps. We have also set up automatic infrastructures for building the
game clients: for Linux we are using
[Travis&nbsp;CI](https://travis-ci.org/unrealarena/) while for Windows
[AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/unrealarena/unrealarena) (OS&nbsp;X
support is coming soon). We chose to use different services in order to provide
always native applications for all the supported platforms.

Finally we have focused on making the game run with a minimal set of
placeholders only and we have also started working on our first map,
*Campgrounds*, a remake of the original *pro-q3dm6* included in Quake III Arena.

Now the time has come to put together all pieces and pack the first release!

Unfortunately this doesn't mean you can already play the game with your friends,
for now you are only allowed to float around through the maps in *spect mode*.
Nevertheless, we have achieved a very important goal because the development
process is now stable and this means it is easier to work on the project and new
updates will be released faster.

That's all for now, go and grab it @
<https://github.com/unrealarena/unrealarena/releases>

[NOTE: since there are no menus you should take a look at the instructions on
the official [wiki](https://github.com/unrealarena/unrealarena/wiki) in order to
know how to properly run the game.]
