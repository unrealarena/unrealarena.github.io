From now on we will split the development between a release and the following
into smaller stages that we are going to call *snapshots*. You can think of them
as developer previews of well defined features that have just been finished and
marked as ready.

In this way it's easier for our testers to review each feature set and at the
same time it allows the developers to deal with any feedback before actually
doing the official release.

The main features included in the snapshot 0.1-1 are:

- removal of the *buildables* from the gamecode
- refining of the Campgrounds geometry

In addition to those, there are the update of the engine to v0.40.0 and a few
bugfixes.

[NOTE: since there are no menus you should take a look at the instructions on
the official [wiki](https://github.com/unrealarena/unrealarena/wiki) in order to
know how to properly run the game.]
