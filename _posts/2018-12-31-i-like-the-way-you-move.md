Here we are with a new snapshot just in time for the new year!

The main focus has been the implementation of VQ3 physics for Q players which we
can proudly say it is 100 percent accurate. We have added a red box with proper
size as a placeholder for the final Q model to better represent it for the time
being. Other than that, characters have now soft shadows, it is possible to
unfollow with the right mouse button when spectating and we added `exit` as an
alias for `quit`.

Other cosmetic additions are a provisional HUD that shows in-game messages and
the FPS counter, a beautiful monospace font for the console and a disclaimer at
the game startup.

Our map Campgrounds underwent a restyling and it now has a cleaner dev look.

Finally thanks to 5 big updates the engine is now on par with the latest
[Daemon](https://github.com/DaemonEngine/Daemon) version (v0.51.1).

Works have already started for the next snapshot which will include UT99
physics and a new map so watch this space for updates!

[NOTE: since there are no menus you should take a look at the instructions on
the official [wiki](https://github.com/unrealarena/unrealarena/wiki) in order to
know how to properly run the game.]
